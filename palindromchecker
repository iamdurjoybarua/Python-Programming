Palindrome Checker
This is a simple Python script that checks if a user-provided word or phrase is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward, such as "level" or "A man a plan a canal Panama."

Key Features
String Pre-processing: The program cleans the input string by removing spaces and converting it to lowercase, ensuring the check is accurate and case-insensitive. "Racecar" and "race car" are both recognized as palindromes.

Efficient Reversal: The code uses a concise Python slice ([::-1]) to create a reversed copy of the string in a single line.

Clear Logic: The core logic is encapsulated in the is_palindrome function, which returns a simple True or False boolean value for easy use in the main program block.

How to Run
Save the code as palindrome_checker.py.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the script using the following command:

python palindrome_checker.py

The program will then prompt you to "Enter a word or phrase:".

Example Usage
Here are a few examples of the program in action:

Enter a word or phrase: racecar
'racecar' is a palindrome.
```bash
Enter a word or phrase: hello world
'hello world' is not a palindrome.
```bash
Enter a word or phrase: A man a plan a canal Panama
'A man a plan a canal Panama' is a palindrome.

Potential Enhancements
Handle Punctuation: Add support for removing punctuation, so phrases like "Madam, I'm Adam." can also be checked.

Interactive Loop: Create a loop to allow the user to check multiple words or phrases without restarting the program.

Two-Pointer Approach: Implement a more memory-efficient algorithm (e.g., a two-pointer approach) to check for palindromes without creating a reversed copy of the string.
