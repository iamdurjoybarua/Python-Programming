## Getting Started

To get started with these programs:

**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

**Download**: You can clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the individual .py files.

**Execution**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the files, and run any of the programs using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python <filename>.py
```
(Replace `<filename>.py` with the actual name of the file you want to run, e.g., `python calculator.py`)

## Usage

Each program's code is self-contained and ready to run. The main logic for each script is located at the top level of the file, providing a clear demonstration of its functionality.

You can modify these programs or create new ones to further explore and extend your Python skills. The provided code includes comments to explain key sections and concepts.
